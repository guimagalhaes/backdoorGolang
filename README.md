# backdoorGolang
Backdoor with Golang (Cross-Plateform)

_/!\ Work in progress, not a stable release /!\_

##Main goal

A fork of my own project named : "pilebones/backdoorBash" (see: https://github.com/pilebones/backdoorBash) but instead of using Bash as programming language (Unix-like only) this new one will work on Windows too by using a Golang API (cross-plateform) developed from scratch (as much as possible).
